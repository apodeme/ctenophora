Scripts

dotreplace.py - input: newick gene tree(s) in text file - give filename as argument. Replace "." in titles of genes with "DOTHERE" -> ALE does not function correctly otherwise

mcldist.py - input: mcl tab file - give filename as argument. gives mcl cluster distribution, outputs into text file. copy into the included excel file.

faoneline.sh - batch convert fasta files to one line. requires ./oneline/wolineone folders. also requires list of files to be converted, use ls -1 *.afa > taxafilenames.txt

move.sh - moves fasta files with less than four sequences (e.g. after trimming or removing duplicates). requires ./lessthanfour directory and fasta files must be in one line format.

removeasterisk.py - input: fasta file. Removes asterisk from end of sequences - otherwise Muscle throws a warning.

removedupeseqs.py - input: fasta file. give filename as argument (can be ran in parallel). fasta headers must contain species name before the gene followed by a forward slash, e.g. "abylopsis/gene1". removes duplicate sequences only if species is same.

agalmacleaner.py - input: fasta file. cleans output of Agalma pipeline such that there is only one copy of each gene in the resulting file. non-overlapping genes are concatenated together if same sense.
